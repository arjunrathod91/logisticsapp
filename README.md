The application facilitates user requests to organizations, including their name, contact details, location, and specific needs. Volunteers can then understand user requirements and reach out to provide assistance.

## How We Built This
We used Figma for setting the UI of our app which helped us to set up our vision towards the app. We used React, Javascript for frontend, for designing purpose we used Bootstrap and fontawesome. For Server side we used Node js and express. For storing the data of users and volunteers we used Mongo DB.

## Challenges Faced

During the development of HelpYours, challenges were encountered, particularly in storing data in MongoDB. Creating new Axios requests for each task posed a unique set of challenges. But we used good use of chatgpt for time saving.

## How It Works

1. **User Requests:**
   - Users send requests to volunteers, providing details such as name, contact information, location, and specific needs.

2. **Volunteer Response:**
   - Volunteers access user requests and reach out to users for further help.

3. **Connection Between Them:**
   - Both connects on a single platform.

## What We Learned
- We both learned lot and we tried actually new things while making this app. Like a Figma, Mongo DB post,get,put requests for each task. So i think what experience we gained while making this app was awesome. 

## Accomplishments
First that we had able to achieve our figma design. We are proud that what we think we are able to deliver. Because we both used Figma first time. We are especially proud of our idea, and believe HelpYours has a unique approach.
